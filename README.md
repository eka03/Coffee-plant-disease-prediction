# Leaf-and-Coffee-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
## Introduction :
Plants play a crucial role in agriculture, providing food, raw materials, and contributing to environmental sustainability. However, plant diseases can severely impact crop yield and quality, posing a significant threat to global food security. Early and accurate detection of plant diseases is essential to mitigate their impact.

This project focuses on detecting leaf conditions and diagnosing diseases in coffee plants using machine learning. By analyzing image data, the project aims to provide an automated solution for plant health monitoring and disease diagnosis.

## Purpose :

The purpose of this project is to explore the application of machine learning techniques in the agricultural domain. The project aims to:

  1. Detect abnormalities in leaf images to assess plant health.<br>
  2. Diagnose common diseases in coffee plants using image-based classification models.
